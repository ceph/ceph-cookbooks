# Chef cookbook [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ceph/ceph-cookbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ceph/ceph-cookbook) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/ceph/ceph-cookbook.png)](https://gitter.im/ceph/ceph-cookbook)

## DESCRIPTION

Installs and configures Ceph, a distributed network storage and filesystem designed to provide excellent performance, reliability, and scalability.

The current version is focused towards deploying Monitors and OSD on Ubuntu.

For documentation on how to use this cookbook, refer to the [USAGE](#USAGE) section.

For help, use [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/ceph/ceph-cookbook), [mailing-list](mailto:ceph-users-join@lists.ceph.com) or [issues](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-cookbook/issues)

### Ceph Metadata Server

Ceph metadata server nodes should use the ceph-mds role.

Includes:

* ceph::default

### Ceph OSD

Ceph OSD nodes should use the ceph-osd role

Includes:

* ceph::default
* ceph::conf

### Ceph Rados Gateway

Ceph Rados Gateway nodes should use the ceph-radosgw role

## Resources/Providers

### ceph\_client

The ceph\_client LWRP provides an easy way to construct a Ceph client key. These keys are needed by anything that needs to talk to the Ceph cluster, including RadosGW, CephFS, and RBD access.

#### Actions

- :add - creates a client key with the given parameters

#### Parameters

- :name - name attribute. The name of the client key to create. This is used to provide a default for the other parameters
- :caps - A hash of capabilities that should be granted to the client key. Defaults to `{ 'mon' => 'allow r', 'osd' => 'allow r' }`
- :as\_keyring - Whether the key should be saved in a keyring format or a simple secret key. Defaults to true, meaning it is saved as a keyring
- :keyname - The key name to register in Ceph. Defaults to `client.#{name}.#{hostname}`
- :filename - Where to save the key. Defaults to `/etc/ceph/ceph.client.#{name}.#{hostname}.keyring` if `as_keyring` and `/etc/ceph/ceph.client.#{name}.#{hostname}.secret` if not `as_keyring`
- :owner - Which owner should own the saved key file. Defaults to root
- :group - Which group should own the saved key file. Defaults to root
- :mode - What file mode should be applied. Defaults to '00640'

### ceph\_cephfs

The ceph\_cephfs LWRP provides an easy way to mount CephFS. It will automatically create a Ceph client key for the machine and mount CephFS to the specified location. If the kernel client is used, instead of the fuse client, a pre-existing subdirectory of CephFS can be mounted instead of the root.

#### Actions

- :mount - mounts CephFS
- :umount - unmounts CephFS
- :remount - remounts CephFS
- :enable - adds an fstab entry to mount CephFS
- :disable - removes an fstab entry to mount CephFS

#### Parameters

- :directory - name attribute. Where to mount CephFS in the local filesystem
- :use\_fuse - whether to use ceph-fuse or the kernel client to mount the filesystem. ceph-fuse is updated more often, but the kernel client allows for subdirectory mounting. Defaults to true
- :cephfs\_subdir - which CephFS subdirectory to mount. Defaults to '/'. An exception will be thrown if this option is set to anything other than '/' if use\_fuse is also true

### ceph\_radosgw

The ceph\_radosgw LWRP provides an easy way to setup customized radosgw servers. The LWRP itself just adds a node attribute, and then the radosgw recipe does all the setup. Due to the way Chef processes the runlist, this resource has to be explicitly converged before compiling the radosgw recipe. Any recipe that calls this LWRP has to say `.run_action(:add)` after the do..end block. Alternatively, the node attributes can be set with a wrapper cookbook.

#### Actions

- :add - Adds the given information as a custom radosgw configuration.

#### Parameters

- :name - name attribute, not used
- :region - what region should be set in the ceph.conf for this radosgw
- :region\_root\_pool - what rados pool should be used to load region information
- :zone - what zone should be set in the ceph.conf for this radosgw
- :zone\_root\_pool - what rados pool should be used to load zone information
- :keyname - what name to use when generating the cephx key for this radosgw. Defaults to client.radosgw.#{zone}.#{hostname}
- :dns\_name - what dns name to use in ceph.conf and Apache
- :dns\_aliases - an optional array of other hostnames to handle requests for in Apache
- :socket\_path - the path to the socket that radosgw will use for fastcgi communications. Defaults to /var/run/ceph/ceph-radosgw.#{zone}.#{hostname}
- :print\_continue - whether to set the `print continue` option in ceph.conf. Defaults to nil, which doesn't set the option, true or false sets the option to the given setting.
